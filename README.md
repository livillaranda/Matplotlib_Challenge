# Analysis from Data
1. The average tumor volume for Capomulin is 40.68 mm<sup>3</sup>, but that is not the smallest average tumor volume. Ramicane has the smallest tumor volume, at 40.22 mm<sup>3</sup>.
2. The tumor volume in 'k403' shrank by 51%, from 45.00 mm<sup>3</sup> to 22.95 mm<sup>3</sup>, over the course of the trial.
3. At the end of the trial, 21 of 25 mice tested with Capomulin survived until the conclusion of the trial. For the rest of the treatments, the ratio of mice to mice survived, is as follows: Ceftamin = 13/25, Infubinol = 9/25, Ketapril = 11/25, Naftisol = 13/25, Placebo = 11/25, Propriva = 7/25, Ramicane = 20/25, Stelasyn = 11/24, and Zoniferol = 14/25. This shows that Capomulin had the highest survival rate, at 84%.
